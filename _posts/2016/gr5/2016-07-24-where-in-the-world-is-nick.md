As you might've noticed, the blog is lagging a bit behind real time. I
want to try to catch it up, so I'm writing more often and will try to
have things queued up so that posts come in a few times each day. That's
a lot for you guys to keep up with, but I think it's a better way to do
it than to post everything all at once. Plus I don't have them all
written yet!

I want to be able to share my adventure with you without having to wait
a week to tell the story. And what's more, I'm nearing the end! So I'm
going to try to focus on getting things caught up and posting more
often.

In the meantime, the photo above shows roughly where I'll be over the
next few weeks, pending weather and fatigue and the rest. I'm in Ceillac
today, at the heart of the Queyras national park. It's a really forested
region that's absolutely beautiful, especially so for me since woods
really are my favorite landscape. I've fallen completely in love with
long distance solo hiking, which I'll talk about more in a later entry.
It's been the trip of a lifetime, full of sights, stories, and
experiences that I wouldn't trade for anything.

Thanks for following along, and I hope you're enjoying your summers as
much as I've been enjoying mine.
