I reached Thann in the late afternoon and had a small lunch at a cafe.
The place was empty except for the family running it. I talked with them
for a few hours in a mix of French, English, German, and Italian, about
my trip and France. Such nice people! It was great company and lifted my
spirits. Bonjour Sophie, buongiorno Alice! They wished me bon courage; I
left about 18:30 and headed for the trail.

And promptly lost it. But then I found it again, and walked on. The rain
held off last night and I walked a few kilometers out of town. First
camp went well. Today it's been rainy, and cold. I found two French guys
who work volunteer at a refuge and I've been waiting out the rain for
the afternoon.

Weak signal, so just writing a short note. I'll try to post more once I
reach a larger town. Was feeling down yesterday but am encouraged today
after seeing people again.
