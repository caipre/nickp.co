I have a few days in Berlin visiting my friends Matt and Jess, and today
I explored some of the city. I started off looking for a place to grab a
coffee and pastry, but nothing caught my eye (despite plenty of
options), and instead I spent most of the day just wandering about.

I went to see Brandenburger Tor, the famous gate that stands between
Tiergarten park and Pariser Platz at the heart of Berlin. Later, I found
an outdoor Turkish market with food, textiles, and various trinkets. I
did some people watching in a park, checked my pass at Berlin
Hauptbahnhoff, took the train a little ways, and bought a journal.

By the end I had made my way from Mitte, the historic center, through
Kreuzberg and into Neuk√∂lln. I walked almost 20 miles in all, which is
not too shabby. On the other hand, I did keep walking late into the day,
it was quite flat, and I wasn't carrying my backpack. But my feet feel
fine, and more importantly, I don't have any hot spots that would cause
blisters. That's good news for hiking.

Tomorrow's mission: find a Berliner.
