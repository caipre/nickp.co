After several days in Berlin, I've been feeling anxious and eager to get
started hiking. I thought about leaving this morning, but ended up
talking with my family late into the night/morning and thought it best
to stay another day. I packed my bag in the morning and, after meeting
Matt and Jess for lunch, headed to Grunewald, a large forested park west
of Berlin. It was well worth it.

For 2.70â‚¬, I took a train far enough out of the city that I thought I'd
missed my stop. The station at the far end of the park was fitting and I
started my walk with a smile.

After miles of city walking the past few days, entering the park was an
immediate encouragement. Large oaks and redwoods shouldered forest paths
and the sounds of the city faded out. Walking long distance seemed to
make sense again.

Like all of Berlin, the park is mostly level ground. The few hills were
built from the city's rubble after the bombings of WWII; they offered
good views of the nearby lake, and modest preparation for the mountains
that loom ahead for me.

I walked all afternoon, eventually covering some 10 miles in the forest
on dirt roads, horse trails, and mountain biking paths. My anxiety about
whether I can actually do this trip yielded a bit, and I started to feel
more comfortable with the idea of hiking for so long.

By the time I'd reached the north side of the forest, though, I was
pretty tired. Nothing hurt, but my feet and shoulders were definitely
ready for some rest.

I took a short nap before heading back into town by train to meet Matt
and Jess for an ice cream. Dark chocolate, pistachio, and hazelnut. Sehr
gut!

Tomorrow (Friday) I plan to catch an early morning train out of the city
and down to France. I'm not sure how strong my signal will be from now
on, so I might not be able to post as many photos, and maybe not every
day. I'll do my best. It should be a beautiful, sunrise ride. Hopefully
I can stay awake.
